## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹   

This is a challenge proposed by the website **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** and this site is great because it helps us improve our **coding skills** with real projects and more varied difficulties. The site gives us the possibility to train any skill or web technology that we want, be it media-querie, grid layout, Jquery, React, etc..

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce this **Countries API** as close as possible to the original design.

In this challenge I used my studies in React Js to make the application consume the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/), in this application you can search for any country in the world, filter countries by continent, change the theme to dark and get more detailed information about each country.
